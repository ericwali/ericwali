### 🧑🏻‍💻 about me </h3>
I started coming into contact with computers when I was 15 years old. It was also since then that I had the first computer in my life.
From then on, I fell in love with this colorful virtual world. What I am different from most of my peers around me is that what I like
is tossing about computers. When I saw the operating system, I wondered how it was installed. At that time, I remember that I bought
a lot of CDs for operating windows system. Basically, I often change an operating system to play. After two years of ordeal, I found 
it meaningless. So I fell in love with programming when I was 17. It was also the first line of code in life written at that time. At present
have been working for 3 years now. In fact, I personally prefer to develop toys. Because I know I may die one day Maybe today or tomorrow But
I am not afraid of death What I fear is that I have been to this world without leaving anything to prove that I have been to this world.
Including now I also prefer to produce things My personal principle is (Production open source is greater than learning, Learning is greater than company),
This is also the motivation for my current open source Because studying may die one day. If you don't produce open source, your knowledge
will be erased in this world, so I want to leave something behind and make some trivial contribution to this world.learning is more important than the
company. If I work overtime every day and don't give me some time to study, I will resign immediately and change it. Because the basis of producing 
open source is that you have enough technical knowledge, So learning is also essential, My goal is not to be a very Great person either I just like to 
open source some tools within my power. And I also decided to finish my short life alone in work related to open source. I am currently a full stack
engineer. ios, Android, Front End, Back End, Will be some If I have any questions about the open source tool, please ask Or please contact me by email.
